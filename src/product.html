        <p>
          Ethereum smart contract protocol for making two-player prisoner's dilemmas.
          The idea was to use this as mutual assurance of good behavior when working remotely
          with people you don't know well. "Successful" deals could act like attestations in a
          decentralized Yelp-type thing.

        <p>Alchemy was DAOstack's primary DAO tool, letting people launch and manage DAOs.</p>
        <p>
          For much of 2020, I handled product direction, including market research, user interviews,
          scoping, mock ups, and high-level understanding of the tech stack.

          Groupmuse's product was lead by beloved co-founder Kyle Schmolze,
          but analysis, discussion, planning, user research were all
          collaborations between the three co-founders.
