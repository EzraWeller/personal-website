            My first big project was
            <a target="_blank" href="https://groupmuse.com/">Groupmuse</a>,
            a platform for crowdsourcing chamber music house shows,
            which I co-founded with
            <a target="_blank" href="https://kyleschmolze.com">Kyle Schmolze</a>
            and
            <a target="_blank" href="https://www.instagram.com/heavy_meadow_/">Sam Bodkin</a>.
            I ran operations, which meant coordinating most of the music and lots of
            business organization stuff.

              A groupmuse might be happening near you: they're fun!
